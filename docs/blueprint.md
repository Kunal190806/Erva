## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Allow users to upload plant leaf images via drag-and-drop or browsing.
- Image Preview: Display a preview of the uploaded image before prediction.
- Disease Prediction: Process the uploaded image using a pre-trained deep learning model to predict whether the leaf is healthy or diseased. The model tool will make an inference based on three internal models: Color-based, Grayscale-based and a model with segmented images
- Prediction Display: Show the prediction result with a confidence score, clearly indicating the health status or specific disease type.
- Disease Information: Provide an option to view additional information about the detected disease, including symptoms and prevention tips (via URL link to external site).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#388E3C) to evoke a sense of nature and health.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a desaturated hue of the primary, providing a natural, calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Earthy brown (#A1887F), analogous to green and beige, used for subtle highlights and important UI elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, neutral, and readable experience.
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent different plant diseases and UI actions.
- Clean, modern layout with a focus on readability and easy navigation. Use of white space to avoid clutter.
- Subtle transitions and animations for loading states and displaying prediction results.
